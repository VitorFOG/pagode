**Pagode** is not a framework ‚Äî it's a modern starter kit for building full-stack web applications using **Go**, **InertiaJS**, and **React**, powered by **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

Pagode provides the structure and tooling you need to hit the ground running, without locking you into rigid conventions or heavyweight abstractions. It balances flexibility and productivity by letting you swap out pieces as needed while still offering a solid foundation of battle-tested technologies.

While JavaScript frontends dominate the landscape, Pagode embraces a hybrid approach: it combines server-side rendering and client-side interactivity to deliver fast, modern user experiences ‚Äî without sacrificing simplicity. Thanks to tools like InertiaJS and Tailwind, you can build reactive, beautiful interfaces with minimal boilerplate and zero custom Webpack/Vite configuration.

Pagode proves that Go is not just for APIs ‚Äî it's a powerful full-stack solution when paired with the right tools. And yes, you still get the control, speed, and simplicity you love about Go.
=======
**Pagode** is not a framework ‚Äî it's a flexible starter kit for building modern full-stack applications with **Go** on the backend and **React** on the frontend, seamlessly connected via **InertiaJS**.

Pagode gives you a production-ready foundation with:
- **Server-side rendering** for fast initial page loads
- **SPA-like experience** with client-side navigation via InertiaJS
- **Beautiful UI components** powered by shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS v4
- **Full-stack type safety** from Go through to your React components
- **Minimal configuration** with sensible defaults that you can customize

Unlike traditional SPAs, Pagode keeps your frontend and backend tightly coupled while still delivering a modern, reactive user experience. You get the performance benefits of server-side rendering combined with the fluid interactivity of a single-page application.

With Go handling the heavy lifting and React providing the UI layer, you can build robust, full-featured web applications without the complexity of a separate API layer or complex build tooling.

#### Backend

- [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/): High performance, extensible, minimalist Go web framework.
- [Ent](https://entgo.io/): Simple, yet powerful ORM for modeling and querying data.
- [Gomponents](https://github.com/maragudk/gomponents): HTML components written in pure Go. They render to HTML 5, and make it easy for you to build reusable components.

#### Frontend

With **server-side rendered HTML** powered by **Go** and **InertiaJS**, you get the best of both worlds ‚Äî a modern SPA-like experience with server-driven logic. Combined with the tools below, you can build beautiful, dynamic UIs without the usual frontend overhead.

- [InertiaJS](https://inertiajs.com/): Bridges your Go backend with modern JavaScript frameworks like React, enabling full-page SPA experiences without building a separate API.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A declarative library for building interactive UIs, perfectly paired with Inertia for dynamic frontend behavior.
- [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs directly in your markup ‚Äî no context switching or naming class conflicts.
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/): A beautifully designed, accessible component library built on top of Tailwind CSS and Radix UI ‚Äî perfect for rapidly building consistent interfaces.
=======
#### Backend

- [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/): High performance Go web framework
- [Ent](https://entgo.io/): Type-safe ORM with code generation
- [InertiaJS Go Adapter](https://inertiajs.com/): Server-side adapter for seamless React integration

#### Frontend

- [InertiaJS](https://inertiajs.com/): Client-side library that bridges Go and React
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): Component-based UI library
- [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/): Utility-first CSS framework
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/): Beautiful, accessible UI components
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Type safety for your frontend code

Pagode's architecture gives you:
- **Server-rendered pages** for SEO and performance
- **Client-side navigation** for SPA-like fluidity
- **Shared data types** between backend and frontend
- **Automatic page refreshes** when data changes
- **Built-in authentication** with session management

Would you like me to continue with more updates to other sections of the README? I can focus on:
1. Updating the Getting Started section to reflect modern tooling
2. Simplifying the UI section since we're using React instead of Gomponents
3. Highlighting the InertiaJS integration patterns
4. Adding more details about the shadcn/ui component usage

Let me know which areas you'd like me to focus on next.

### Foundation

While many great projects were used to build this, all of which are listed in the [credits](#credits) section, the following provide the foundation of the back and frontend. It's important to note that you are **<ins>not required to use any of these</ins>**. Swapping any of them out will be relatively easy.

#### Update this documentation to reflect my project, Pagode ‚Äî a full-stack starter kit that uses Go for the backend, InertiaJS to bridge the backend with React, and Tailwind CSS v4 along with shadcn/ui for styling and UI components. Emphasize that it's not a framework but a flexible foundation for building modern web apps with server-side rendering and a smooth SPA-like experience.  

I'll help update the documentation to reflect Pagode. Based on the files shown, these are the most likely files that would need to be edited to update the documentation:

1. README.md (new file - would need to be created)
2. docs/overview.md (new file - would need to be created)
3. docs/getting-started.md (new file - would need to be created)
4. docs/architecture.md (new file - would need to be created)

The documentation would need to cover:
- Pagode's purpose as a starter kit (not a framework)
- The tech stack (Go, InertiaJS, React, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui)
- Key features like SSR and SPA-like experience
- How to get started
- Project structure and architecture

Would you like me to proceed with creating these documentation files? Please confirm and I'll provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for each one.

I'll help update the README.md to better reflect Pagode's modern stack. Here are the key changes needed:

1. Update the introduction and overview sections
2. Modernize the tech stack descriptions
3. Highlight InertiaJS + React integration
4. Emphasize Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui components
5. Clarify it's a starter kit, not a framework
